        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to everyone - members, visitors, and anyone interested in country music. Our goal is to share information about club activities and the wider Country Music scene in the Canterbury area.
        </p>
        <p>Musicians, singers, supporters of country music, members and non-members are welcome to gather on Club nights, and if you have other country music events, both in the Canterbury region and wider New Zealand, we are happy to put this info up on our Community or Wider Club pages. We love to share and enjoy Country music together.
        </p>
        <p>WB Country Music Club is an established club; it was started approximately 30 years ago, by enthusiastic supporters of Country Music.
